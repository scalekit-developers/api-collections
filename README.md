# Scalekit API Collections

This directory contains API collections that help you explore and test Scalekit APIs in various API platforms and tools. [Refer to spec folder for the latest OpenAPI spec](/spec/).

## Available Collections

### Postman Collection

The `postman` directory contains ready-to-use Postman collections and environments for testing Scalekit APIs. These collections include:

- Authentication flows
- Single Sign-On (SSO) endpoints
- Organization management APIs
- Admin portal APIs
- Connection management endpoints

See the [Postman README](./postman/README.md) for setup instructions.

### Bruno Collection (Coming Soon)

The `bruno` directory will contain collections for [Bruno](https://www.usebruno.com/), a lightweight alternative to Postman. We're waiting for your feature requests to add Bruno collections - check the [Bruno README](./bruno/README.md) to learn more or request collections.

## Why Use These Collections?

1. **Quick Start**: Get up and running with Scalekit APIs in minutes
2. **Pre-configured**: Environment variables and authentication flows are already set up
3. **Learning Tool**: Understand API capabilities through practical examples
4. **Testing**: Easily test integrations in your development environment
